# hello-world
An exploration into the Github world.

I am trying to learn git hub so I don't have to keep copying files to server/thumbdrive/development computer at work/development computer at home.  This is being frustrated by a dog that needs to bark everytime someone else moves in the house.  Said dog is now on house arrest in her crate.
